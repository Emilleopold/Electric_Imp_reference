===================================

Author: [Tom Byrne](https://github.com/tombrew/)

## Hardware Setup
The ST485 requires three pins to use: One non-flow-controlled UART and a GPIO for TX enable. Any imp UART can be used. 

The ST485 is used in the [Kaylee](https://electricimp.com/docs/hardware/resources/reference-designs/kaylee/) reference design.
