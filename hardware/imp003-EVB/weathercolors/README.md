Weather Colors Example for imp003 EVB
==============================
In this example we connect the RGB LED on the imp003 EVB to the current temperature with the [WeatherUnderground API](http://api.wunderground.com/weather/api/). You will need to sign up for a free WeatherUnderground API key to use this example.
